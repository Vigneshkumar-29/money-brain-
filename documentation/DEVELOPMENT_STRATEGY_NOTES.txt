DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY NOTES & Q/A SUMMARY

1. OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY (Offline-First Architecture)
-----------------------------------------------------
Q: Can the app work without an internet connection and sync later?
A: Yes.
   - Strategy: Use a local database (SQLite/WatermelonDB) on the device.
   - Workflow:
     1. User adds data -> Saved immediately to Local DB (works offline).
     2. App maintains a "Sync Queue" of pending changes.
     3. Background Service listens for internet.
     4. When online -> Pushes queue to Supabase Backend.
   - Tools: PowerSync or RxDB are recommended for easier Supabase offline syncing.

2. SUPABASE COSTS & ALTERNATIVES
-----------------------------------------------------
Q: Can we cut Supabase subscription costs or use Excel?
A: 
   option A: Supabase Free Tier (Recommended)
     - You do NOT need to pay. The free tier is valid for up to 50,000 monthly users and 500MB database size, which is sufficient for a personal finance app.
   
   Option B: Google Sheets as Backend
     - Possible via Google Sheets API.
     - Pros: User owns the data in their Drive. Readable file format.
     - Cons: Slower performance, complex query logic, security management is harder.

3. UPI PAYMENT INTEGRATION
-----------------------------------------------------
Q: Can users scan QR codes and pay via GPay/Paytm, and auto-save the transaction?
A: Yes, with limitations.
   - Mechanism:
     1. App scans UPI QR Code (extracts string `upi://pay?...`).
     2. App uses React Native `Linking.openURL()` to deep-link to GPay/Paytm.
     3. User completes payment in the external app.
   
   - The "Callback" Limitation:
     - GPay/Paytm do NOT send a success signal back to personal apps (only to registered merchants).
     - Your app won't know automatically if the payment succeeded.
   
   - Solution:
     - After redirecting user to GPay, show a dialogue: "Did you complete the payment?"
     - User clicks "Yes" -> App saves the transaction (e.g., "Milk - $20") to the database.
